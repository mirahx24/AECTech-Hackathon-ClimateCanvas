# Climate Canvas: Interactive Art Exhibit

Climate Canvas is an interactive art exhibit that challenges designers to rethink their design decisions in light of the future climate. By incorporating climate data from Los Angeles (LA) for both current and projected future conditions, the exhibit aims to raise awareness about the potential impact of design choices on our environment.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend development.
- p5.js library for generating interactive visuals.
- ml5.js library for machine learning for web applicatio.
- PoseNet library for guesture detection.
- Processing for Generative Art using climate data for LA.
- Voice recording and playback for delivering prompts and questions.
- Web-based camera detection for measuring audience responses (hand raising).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mirahx24/AECTech-Hackathon-ClimateCanvas`
2. Open the project folder: `cd AECTech-Hackathon-ClimateCanvas`
3. Launch the exhibit by opening `home.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the exhibit, the audience will be greeted with an immersive art installation representing the current climate conditions in LA.
3. The audience can respond by raising their hands, which will be detected using the webcam.
4. Based on the audience's response, the art will dynamically transform to reflect different scenarios and potential outcomes.
5. The exhibit will provide a visual representation of the future climate in LA and stimulate conversations about sustainable design practices.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding voice clip for question prompting.
- Incorporate real-time climate data to provide up-to-date visualizations.
- Expand the exhibit to include multiple locations and climate scenarios.
- Introduce additional interactive elements to engage the audience further.
- Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze audience responses and generate personalized art experiences.
- Create a data visualization dashboard to display historical and projected climate data.
